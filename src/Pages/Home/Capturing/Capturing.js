  <p className="py-6 text-xl font-semibold">When listing your phone for resale, high-quality photos are essential to make a good first impression. Ensure your images are well-lit, showcase the phone from various angles, and highlight any unique features or accessories included. In your description, be honest and provide accurate details about the phone's specifications, condition, and any remaining warranty. Clearly state what is included in the sale, such as charging cables, original packaging, or additional accessories. Honesty and transparency go a long way in building trust with potential buyers.</p>
