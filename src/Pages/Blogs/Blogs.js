          What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?
        </h4>
        <p>
          There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in your
          React apps: <br /> 1.Local state,
          <br /> 2.Global state, <br />
          3.Server state,
          <br /> 4.URL state

        <h4 className="text-xl"> How does prototypical inheritance work?</h4>
        <p>
          The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add
          methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object
          can inherit the properties and methods of another object.
          Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object,
          we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.

        <h4 className="text-xl">Why should we write unit tests?</h4>
        <p>
          Unit testing ensures that all code meets quality standards before it's
          deployed. This ensures a reliable engineering environment where
          quality is paramount. Over the course of the product development life
          cycle, unit testing saves time and money, and helps developers write
          better code, more efficiently.

        <h4 className="text-xl"> React vs. Angular vs. Vue?</h4>
        <p>
          React can be used as a UI library to render elements, without
          enforcing a specific project structure, and that’s why it’s not
          strictly a framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          AngularJS, the original framework, is an MVC (Model-View-Controller)
          framework. But in Angular 2, there’s no strict association with
          MV*-patterns as it is also component-based.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Vue.js core library focuses on the View layer only. It’s called a
          progressive framework because you can extend its functionality with
          official and third-party packages, such as Vue Router or Vuex, to turn
          it into an actual framework.
